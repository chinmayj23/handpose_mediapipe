1. total 27 DOF as described below,

WRIST: 6 DOF - 3 rotation and 3 translation
THUMB_CMC: 2 DOF - one in flexion direction and other in abduction direction
THUMB_MCP: 1 DOF - no abduction like in other fingers' MCP
all _MCP joints except THUMB_MCP: 2 DOF - one in flexion direction and other in abduction direction
all _PIP and _DIP joints and THUMB_IP: 1 DOF (only in flexion direction)
all _TIP joints: 0 DOF (since its not a joint)

2. If we compute the angle of joints along all 3 axes (pitch, roll, and yaw), we can combine them to form a rotation matrix of the joint. 
   We basically compute R_x, R_y, and R_z, and then their dot product, i.e. R_zyx should provide us the rotation matrix.

3. It can be computed as the Eucledian distance between the keypoint pair forming the bone. But this will be in pixel coordinates and not in the metric system. 
   To convert it to a metric scale we need to acquire a conversion factor.
